  <h3>Report</h3>
  <p>Friday's weather was gorgeous.  Sunday's weather was lovely.  We
  rode Saturday.  That's rando.</p>
  <p>We had a good group of 8 riders, including veterans and riders
  new to randonneuring. Two riders came down from Seattle to support
  the opening of a new region (thanks!); the remainder were from
  Eugene and Springfield. Everyone arrived at the start prepared for
  a rainy ride.</p>
  <p>For a little time at the departure point it was fairly dry, but
  rain 
  began to fall a few minute before the start.  At the finish, one
  rider reported that the rain fell predictably whenever he removed
  his rain jacket.  Another reported that it never rained again after
  he donned his rain legs in Alsea, but a rider not far behind him had
  steady rain through the same segment of the ride.  No one complained
  of insufficient rain.</p>
  <p>Still, everyone did well.  There were no DNFs, nor any stories of
  changing a flat in a downpour or puking in a ditch.  Everyone (save
  the pre-rider a week before) finished with at least an hour in the
  bank. Despite some hard climbs and some long climbs and some
  questionable dining choices and lots of moisture, overall it appears
  that riders enjoyed a scenic and challenging ride. We're going to
  call it a success.</p>
  <p>Thanks to the intrepid riders who didn't let a rainy day stop
  them from riding 127 hilly miles.   It's a promising start for
  randonneuring in the southern Willamette Valley.</p>

  <h3>Requirements</h3>
  <p>This ride is now over, but this information may be useful to
  riders considering future brevets.</p>
  <p>This brevet is sanctioned by Audax Club Parisien and Randonneurs
  USA, and is subject to <a
  href="https://rusa.org/pages/rulesForRiders">RUSA Rules for
  Riders.</a>  If you are not familiar with these rules, please
  read them well in advance so that you can be prepared.  They are
  <emph>not</emph> the same as a club century ride.</p>
  <p>
  Your bicycle must be equipped with front and rear lights,
  even if you expect to finish in daylight.  After dusk, you must
  use your lights. 
  You must carry adequate reflective garments, preferably conforming
  to
  <a href="https://rusa.org/reflectivity/">RUSA reflectivity
  guidelines</a>.  If you are observed riding in low light conditions
  with inadequate lights or reflectivity, you will be
  disqualified.</p>
  <p>Familiarize yourself with procedures for riding a brevet,
  incuding collection of times and signatures on the control card.
  The card must be signed and turned in at the finish.</p>
  <h3>What to expect</h3>
  <p>This is a self-supported ride. There is no SAG.  Food and
  drinks are available at markets along the route. Randonneuring
  rules prohibit personal support vehicles or other
  personal support except at the
  controles, which are marked on the route.  </p>
  <p>This is an all-conditions ride. There will be some kind of
  weather.  Maybe it will be wonderful, 
  and maybe it won't.  Come prepared.  Unless you feel your life or
  health are at risk, ride through.</p>
  <p>Expect this to be a little tougher than a typical club century
  ride. You need not be a fast rider, but it takes some discipline
   to move efficiently through the controles. Remember,
   the clock doesn't stop, even when you do!  The slower you ride,
  the more important is your &ldquo;controle discipline.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Most important: Be safe, and enjoy the ride.</p>
