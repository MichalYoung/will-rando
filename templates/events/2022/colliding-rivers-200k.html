    <h3>Route</h3>
    <p>The colliding rivers route, designed by James Taylor,
        treats riders to beautiful scenery through the rolling verdant hills around the Umpqua River Basin.
        Most of the roads on this loop are peaceful and have little traffic. Early in the day you will follow the North
        Umpqua River to your first control at the Colliding Rivers View Point, where the North Umpqua River and Little
        River collide head on.  It can be quite dramatic when the rains have been heavy.
    </p><p>
        About 50 miles into the ride you will encounter the South Umpqua River which you will cross twice before coming
        to state highway 42 where the shoulder is mostly wide with little debris at this time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Leaving highway 42, after the control at Tenmile, you will begin a climb that will lead you to Reston Ridge,
        which you will ride parallel to for a number of miles.
        When you reach the control at Melrose, be sure to stock up on food and plenty of water as you have 46.5 miles
        left to go with no services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Shortly after leaving Melrose you will have a view of the confluence of the North and South Umpqua Rivers,
        forming the main stem of the Umpqua River. Veering away from the river for a while, you will encounter vast
        acreages of vineyards before reaching Tyee Road, which follows the river for about twenty miles.
    </p>
    <p>
        Leaving the Umpqua River at highway 138, you will meet the final climb of the ride, after which you will turn
        off onto Green Valley Road before coming to the Rochester Covered Bridge and the finish at Romuloâ€™s Mexican
        Grill in Sutherlin, where the food is fast, hearty, and reasonably priced.
    </p>

  <h3>Requirements</h3>

    <p>As a condition of participation, you will be asked to
        sign a release and waiver of liability
        at the ride start.  <a href="/static/downloads/Sample-release.pdf">Read it now</a>
        so that you are familiar with it.  Be sure you know what you're getting into and
        are prepared and comfortable with the risks.</p>

  <p>This brevet is sanctioned by Audax Club Parisien and Randonneurs
  USA, and is subject to <a
  href="https://rusa.org/pages/rulesForRiders">RUSA Rules for
  Riders.</a>  If you are not familiar with these rules, please
  read them well in advance so that you can be prepared.  They are
    <emph>not</emph> the same as a club century ride.</p>
    <p>RUSA membership is required to participate. </p>
  <p>
  Your bicycle must be equipped with front and rear lights,
  even if you expect to finish in daylight.  After dusk, you must
  use your lights. 
  You must carry adequate reflective garments, preferably conforming
  to
  <a href="https://rusa.org/reflectivity/">RUSA reflectivity
  guidelines</a>.  If you are observed riding in low light conditions
  with inadequate lights or reflectivity, you will be
  disqualified.</p>
  <p>Familiarize yourself with procedures for riding a brevet,
  incuding collection of times and signatures on the control card.
  The card must be signed and turned in at the finish.</p>
  <h3>What to expect</h3>
  <p>This is a self-supported ride. There is no SAG.  Food and
  drinks are available at markets along the route, but there
      are extensive sections without services, so
      be sure to provision well.  I expect two bottles will be
      enough for most riders in spring weather.  Randonneuring
  rules prohibit personal support vehicles or other
  personal support except at the
  controles, which are marked on the route.  </p>
  <p>This is an all-conditions ride. There will be some kind of
  weather.  Maybe it will be wonderful, 
  and maybe it won't.  Come prepared.  Unless you feel your life or
  health are at risk, ride through.</p>
  <p>Expect this to be somewhat tougher than a typical club century
  ride.
      You need not be a fast rider, but it takes some discipline
   to move efficiently through the controles. Remember,
   the clock doesn't stop, even when you do!  The slower you ride,
  the more important is your &ldquo;controle discipline.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Most important: Be safe, and enjoy the ride.</p>
