                Randonneuring, also known as audax, is long-distance, mostly
                unsupported cycling
                (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randonneuring">more</a>).
                Willamette Randonneurs is a group of randonneurs and those
                interested in randonneuring in the southern Willamette Valley and
                surrounding areas. Willamette Randonneurs was formed in late 2016,
                with our first official season in calendar year 2017.

    <h2>2025 Calendar</h2>
    <p>ACP-sanctioned events are set in September of the preceding year.
        These dates are therefore fixed, but the routes could potentially vary.  Contact the RBA
        in particular if you would like to volunteer to organize an ACP brevet on one of these dates
        with the same length but on a different route.  Routes must be approved by the RUSA routes committee,
        so plan ahead and allow time for review and revision if you wish to propose a new brevet route.</p>
    <p> The calendar does not yet include RUSA-sanctioned events, including populaires and longer brevets.
        I hope there will be several.
        These can be added with relatively short notice.  Please consider whether you would be able and
        willing to organize one or more events this year.  You can ride and organize an event on the same day,
        of if you prefer you can pre-ride before your event.  Contact the RBA to discuss or volunteer.
