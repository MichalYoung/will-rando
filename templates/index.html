      300k ACP brevet.  Tentative route is to Florence via Triangle

	300km is 186 miles, but expect this to be a little harder than
	your average double century.  We will have a staffed control
	in the most remote stretch, near the summit on the return via
	Smith River. Lights will be required, although some fast
	riders may be able to complete the ride in daylight.
